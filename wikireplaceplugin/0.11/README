Notes
=====

This plugin allows you to search and replace text in wiki pages.

It is based on the wikirename plugin: http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WikiRenamePlugin.

After replacing a new version of the wiki page is created with a log of the changes.

You can access the page search & replace form through the Admin system > Wiki Replace.
