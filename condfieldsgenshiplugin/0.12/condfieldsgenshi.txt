What is CondFieldsGenshi for?
-----------------------------

With the help of this Trac plugin you can hide or show fields when
creating or viewing a ticket, depending on the ticket type. Only the
presentation changes, not the contents of the ticket.

CondFieldsGenshi is derived from the "Dynamic fields by ticket type" Plugin
[1], but it is completely based on Genshi now instead of using
Javascript. Moreover, you can select whether selected fields are hidden
or shown by default.

This plugin is "standalone"; the patch
"blackmagic-conditionalfields.patch" in [1] did not match with newer
releases of Trac 0.11.


Example
-------

First, configure trac.ini as in this example:

  [components]
  condfieldsgenshi.* = enabled

  ...

  [condfieldsgenshi]
  tweaks = field1, field2
  default = disable
  field1.type_cond = defect
  field2.type_cond = task


Effect:

Now field1 will be shown only if the ticket type is "defect", field2
only if the ticket type is "task".

The entry "default = disable" means that the field listed under "tweaks"
are NOT shown by default.
The default value is "default = enable".

To disable/enable a field independent of the ticket type, simply write a line
like

  field1.type_cond = None

(supposed there is no "None" type :-).

When you change the ticket type, you must type "submit" before you can
see the effect of of CondFieldsGenshi (some times, also "preview" works).


Bug fix done for "type" field
-----------------------------

When the ticket type is given as an URL parameter only:

.../newticket?type=task

and the ticket type field is disabled, this plugin works nevertheless
(in contrast to the Dynamic fields by ticket type plugin, cf. [1]).

The type field label is extended by "(Fixed)" in this case now.


Extensions
----------

It should be easy to implement showing or hiding fields based on further
parameters as wanted in

Comparison with DynamicFieldsPlugin
-----------------------------------

The DynamicFieldsPlugin [2] has similar and more powerful
features than CondFieldsGenshi but it can change the field contents: When the
user changes the type and some fields vanish, the values in these fields
are lost and will not appear again even if the former type is restored.
A rule "(fieldname).clear_on_hide = false" avoids this but then the
field is shown anyway.

There are other problems reported about the DynamicFieldsPlugin:

- Very slow performance for a larger number of custom fields [3] are
  obviously caused by javascript in the DynamicFieldsPlugin.
  CondFieldsGenshi is based on Genshi and thus does filtering on the server
  side with much higher performance.

- Problems when sorting the fields as reported in [4] are also due to
  some bug in the javascript and should not happen for CondFieldsGenshi.
