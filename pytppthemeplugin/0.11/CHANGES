What's new in version 2.2.1
---------------------------

- This version goes for fans of continuous pages. It provides better
  control for page width adding scroll bars when content doesn't fit in
  the page. But there is no vertical overflow, hence contents are
  scrolled and there is no fixed elements (i.e. banners, metanav,
  mainnav, ctxnav).

What's new in version 2.2.0
---------------------------

- Now Wiki page contents are displayed correctly in MS IE. This browser
  is extremely buggy and it doesn't handle the `float` property
  appropriately.

- Wiki pages include drop-caps. White letters are diplayed on a
  dark-green background. Some pages are not rendered correctly, but a
  patch can be applied to revert that.

- Footer has been moved. Now it is inside contents pane.

- Text indentation has been added.
